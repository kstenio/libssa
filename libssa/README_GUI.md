# LIBSsa2 - Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy spectra analyzer

**LIBSsa 2** is free software, licensed under the **GNU Affero General Public License version 3**, 
and written in **Python 3.x** for analyzing **LIBS spectra**. It can read several formats of data inside raw/text files,
import the spectra, and perform multiple analyses on the data. The environment (spectra, peaks, and results) may also be saved 
into an encapsulated **lb2e** file.

For a full list of features implemented in LIBSsa, you may check the [FEATURES.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kstenio/libssa/master/FEATURES.md) file but, in short, you can: 
remove of outliers using SAM or MAD algorithms, perform full spectrum normalization (FSN), create correlation spectrum, 
do peak isolation, peak fitting (Gaussian, Lorentzian, and Voigt), univariate linear models, multivariate partial least 
squares regression (PLSR), principal components analysis (PCA), and obtain plasma temperature and electron density values 
using Saha-Boltzmann (modified to LIBS) equation.

Bellow are presented some of the graphics generated by LIBSsa.

Finally, users can also export the results of the analysis in many common formats (**txt**, **csv**, and **xlsx**).

## Setting up the environment

You will need to install Python 3 to use the program (tested on 3.9 and 3.10 with current libraries). Python can be obtained from 
the official website, [https://www.python.org/](https://www.python.org/) and, if you have any additional inquiries, there are 
official instructions on how install Python on [Linux Distributions](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html), 
[Windows](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html) and [macOS](https://docs.python.org/3/using/mac.html).

With Python installed, you'll need to download the [software zip](https://github.com/kstenio/libssa/archive/refs/heads/master.zip), 
or clone the repository using [git](https://git-scm.com/):

```shell
git clone https://github.com/kstenio/libssa.git
cd libssa
```

Then, install the following **_external libraries_** that LIBSsa uses:

1. [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) (~=1.25.1)
2. [SciPy](https://scipy.org/) (~=1.11.1)
3. [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) (~=2.0.3)
4. [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) (~=1.3.0)
5. [PySide6](https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_for_Python) (~=6.4.3)
6. [PyQtGraph](https://pyqtgraph.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) (~=0.13.3)
7. [OpenPyXL](https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) (~=3.1.2)
8. [Psutil](https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil) (~=5.9.5)
9. [Markdown](https://python-markdown.github.io/) (~=3.4.3) 

The `requirements.txt` file lists all the above libraries needed, and you can install them using the 
[PIP](https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html) tool. From inside the application folder, open a **terminal** or 
**Windows PowerShell** and type:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt --user
```

And with all set up, feel free to run LIBSsa: 

```shell
python libssa.py
```

Please note that I **did not test LIBSsa with newer versions of Python or libraries**, so using Python >3.9 or different versions 
of the libraries may lead to misbehaviour. 

Lastly, advanced users are encouraged to use [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) (Virtual Environment).

## Historical background

The **LIBSsa 1** was a software created in the middle of 2017 for my personal use in a LIBS class during my doctorate.
Eventually, many colleagues from the _Optics and Photonics Laboratory_ at [Embrapa Instrumentation](https://www.embrapa.br/en/instrumentacao)
(Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil) enjoyed the application, and I continued developing it until late 2019.

At some point, the _LIBSsa_ software became an important part of my [doctorate/thesis](https://repositorio.ufscar.br/handle/ufscar/18072),
so I decided to restructure it into a new - _better_ - version. Finally, in the middle of 2020,
the development of **LIBSsa 2** started.

of Higher Education Personnel - Brazil (CAPES) - Finance Code 001, and by the Laboratory of Optics and Photonics 
at Embrapa Instrumentation, under the supervision of Dr. Debora Milori.
